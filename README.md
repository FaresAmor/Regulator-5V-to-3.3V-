# 5V to 3.3V Regulator PCB Design (Altium Designer)

## Overview
This project features the design of a simple two-layer PCB in **Altium Designer** for voltage regulation from **5V to 3.3V**. The design is compact and optimized for low-noise power conversion.

## Components Used
- **Voltage Regulator:** MIC5317-3.3YM5-TR
- **Capacitors:** 2 × CMP-03422-000182-1 (1µF, 10V, X7R, 0805)
- **Connector:** 2 × SM02B-GHS-TB(LF)(SN)

## Features
✔️ **Compact PCB layout** with two layers  
✔️ **Efficient voltage regulation** from 5V to 3.3V  
✔️ **Designed for low-noise applications**  

## Files Included
📁 **Altium Project Files** (.SchDoc, .PcbDoc)  
📁 **Gerber Files** (for PCB fabrication)  
📁 **BOM (Bill of Materials)**  

## Installation & Usage
1. Open the **Altium Designer** software.
2. Load the provided **.SchDoc** and **.PcbDoc** files.
3. Review and modify the design as needed.
4. Generate Gerber files for PCB manufacturing.
